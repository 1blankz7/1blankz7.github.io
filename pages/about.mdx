Hello and nice to meet you. My name is Christian and this is my personal website. This website will reflect my different
interests and I hope that it will bring value to one or another community.

## researcher
After studying computer engineering and computer science I started working in the tech industry. In 2019 I started
doing my PHD at the University of Bremen. My research interests shifted from gesture recognition and augmented reality
to testing and machine learning.

## founder
I am the founder of [Lemon Research GmbH](https://lemonade-research.de) and [Cubicl GmbH](https://cubicl.de). I support
and guide a young team of talented people and work with them together to digitalize the German "Mittelstand".
