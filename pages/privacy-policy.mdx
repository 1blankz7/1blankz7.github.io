### b. Legal basis for the processing of personal data

### Google Conversion Tag

We use the online advertising program "Google Ads" on our website and, in this context, conversion tracking (analysis of visitor activity). Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service of Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google").

If you are ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is the data controller. Google Ireland Limited is therefore the company affiliated with Google which is responsible for processing your data and for ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your computer. These cookies have a limited validity, do not contain any personal information and are therefore not personally identifiable. If you visit certain pages on our site and the cookie hasn't expired, Google and we can tell that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to that page. Each Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. As a result, there is no way that cookies can be tracked across the websites of ads customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who have clicked on one of our ads and been redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive information that personally identifies users. Your information may be transferred to the USA. Google has certified itself under the US-EU Privacy Shield Agreement and is committed to complying with the European Data Protection Directives.

You can disable personalized advertising for you in Google's advertising settings. You can find instructions on how to do this at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de. You can find more information and Google's privacy policy at https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.

### Google Tag Manager

Please note that we use the Google Tag Manager. The Google Tag Manager itself does not collect any personal data. The Tag Manager makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. Tags are small code elements that are used, among other things, to measure traffic and visitor behavior, to measure the impact of online advertising and social channels, to set up remarketing and targeting, and to test and optimize websites. We use the Tag Manager for the Google services Google Analytics and GA Audience. If you have deactivated the tag, the Google Tag Manager will take this deactivation into account.

## SOCIAL MEDIA, THIRD PARTY CONTENT & TOOLS

### Integration of third party services and content

Within the framework of our website, we use offers from third parties on the basis of consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 f) DSGVO or, if consent is not available in individual cases and is not legally required, on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in evaluating the use of our website and improving the operation of our website within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 f) DSGVO) in order to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").

This may require the respective third party providers to be aware of your IP address, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the Content to your browser. The IP address is therefore necessary for the delivery and display of this content. The third party providers may also use so-called "pixel tags" (non-visible graphic files, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" enable the user behaviour on this website to be analysed. The pseudonymous information may be stored in cookies on your device and may contain, for example, technical information about visiting times, browser and operating system, previously visited website and other information about the use of our website. There is no link to similar information from other sources. If you do not want pixel tags to record your usage behavior, you can object to the data collection at any time

### YouTube

We may include videos from the "YouTube" platform of the provider Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. You can find their data protection information at: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ You can set an opt-out under this link: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.

### Google Maps

We may include maps of the Google Maps service of the provider Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The processed data may include, in particular, IP addresses and location data of the users, which, however, are not collected without their consent (usually in the context of the settings of their mobile devices).

### LinkedIn

Our Internet pages use a function of the LinkedIn network. The provider is the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. If you click on the LinkedIn button (plug-in), you will be redirected to our LinkedIn site in a separate browser window and can follow us on LinkedIn if you are logged in to your LinkedIn account. The plug-in establishes a direct connection between your browser and the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn thereby receives information that you have visited our website with your IP address. In addition, LinkedIn is then able to track your visit to our website - if you are logged in to your LinkedIn account - to you and your account. We would like to point out that we have no knowledge of the content of the (personal) data transmitted or how LinkedIn uses it. For further information, please see the LinkedIn privacy policy at: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy

## APPLICANT DATA

We process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. The processing can also take place electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits appropriate application documents to us electronically, for example by e-mail. If a contract of employment is concluded with an applicant, the transmitted data is stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in accordance with the statutory provisions. If no contract of employment is concluded, the application documents are automatically deleted six months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the person responsible conflict with deletion.

## CHANGES

The responsible person reserves the right to adapt security and data protection measures, as far as this becomes necessary due to technical or legal developments. In these cases, the responsible person will also adapt these data protection notes accordingly. Therefore, please note the current version of our data protection information.
