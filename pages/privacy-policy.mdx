## GENERAL INFORMATION ON DATA PROCESSING

### a. Scope & purpose of processing personal data

As a matter of principle, we process your personal data as a user of this website only to the extent that this is necessary for the provision of a functional website and our contents and services. Your personal data will only be processed with your consent for the intended purpose, unless data processing is permitted by law even without obtaining prior consent. The purposes of the processing result from the processing activities described in detail below.

### b. Legal basis for the processing of personal data

Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 a) EU Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) serves as the legal basis. If the processing of your data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, Art. 6 para. 1 b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations which are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. If processing of your personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject, Art. 6 para. 1 c) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. In the event that vital interests of you or another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 d) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. If the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and if your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not outweigh the former, Art. 6 para. 1 f) DPA serves as the legal basis for the processing.

### c. Data deletion and storage period

Your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for which it was stored no longer applies. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by law or other binding legal regulations. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned legal provisions expires, unless it is necessary to continue storing the data in order to conclude or fulfil a contract.
